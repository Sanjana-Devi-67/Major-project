An Airbnb project clone is a web application built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, designed to emulate the core functionalities of Airbnb. The platform features robust User Authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It includes a comprehensive Property Listings module where hosts can showcase their properties with detailed descriptions, images, pricing, and availability. Guests can browse these listings and leave Reviews and Ratings, providing feedback and helping other users make informed choices. The MVC architecture ensures the application is well-organized, scalable, and easy to maintain, making it an ideal project for learning or real-world deployment.
